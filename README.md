# Warlords 

**Warlords**  is a 2D pvp strategy-siege game inspired by [Warlords 2 – Rise of Demons]( https://www.flashgames.it/warlords2.html).

The game consists of a **clash** between two players, both with scores, in a `battlefield`. Players have different types of `units` to deploy in combat, in `lanes`, against the opponent's troops with the aim of reaching the end of the lane to **score points**.
